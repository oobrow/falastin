# Palestine Casualty Data Visualization

An interactive web visualization displaying casualty statistics from Gaza, prompting reflection on conflict, accountability, and human cost.

## Overview

This project visualizes death toll data from Palestine through an animated, interactive display. Each dot represents lives lost, creating a humanized view of statistical data that often becomes abstracted in news reporting.

## Features

- **Real-time Data**: Fetches current casualty figures from Tech for Palestine API
- **Multi-language Display**: English, Romanized Arabic, and Arabic
- **Interactive Timeline**: Click to cycle through different time periods
- **Visual Metaphor**: Dots move within boundaries, unable to escape their confined space

## Purpose & Questions

This visualization aims to:
- Make abstract casualty numbers more tangible and human
- Encourage viewers to engage with difficult questions about ongoing conflict
- Prompt reflection on proportionality, civilian protection, and international law
- Question what levels of civilian casualties are acceptable in military operations

## Data Context

The visualization presents official casualty counts while viewers can consider:
- What military objectives justify these civilian casualties?
- How do these numbers compare to casualties in similar conflicts?
- What international standards apply to civilian protection?

## Technical Implementation

- HTML5 Canvas animation
- Responsive design
- API integration for real-time data
- Physics-based particle system
